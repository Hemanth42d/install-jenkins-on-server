# Install Jenkins On server

In this Repository we will discuss how to install jenkins on ubuntu server.

- There are **2 Ways** to install jenkins on server.
  - Install Jenkins directly on Os ( Requires manual effect)
   Run Jenkins on Docker container.

## Common steps

1. Create a server
2. Configure Firewall Setting for the server.
    - 22 --> SSH
    - 8080 --> jenkins (open port for incoming requests)
3. Connect it via ssh from your machine
   - ```bash ssh <instance_name>@<ip_address> ```   


## Install jenkins directly on Os


## Run Jenkins as Docker Container

> Additional Info
>  Generate SSH Key
> ```bash
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yourEmail@gmail.com"
> # -t = type ==> rsa
> # -b 4096 ==> Key length (4096 bits is secure).
> # -C "your_email@example.com" ==> A label for the key (often your email).
> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
>```
>1. Install Docker in the instance.
>```bash
>sudo apt update
>sudo apt install docker.io
># if your server is not loged in as root user then add the current user to docker group
>sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
>```
>2. Install jenkins container in the server
>```bash
>docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d \
>-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home  jenkins/jenkins:lts
># (name refernece):(server_Path)   (Image name)
># 50000 --> This is the port where jenkins master and worker nodes communicate, ( jenkins can be actually build and started as a cluster )
># 8080 --> jenkins runs on this port
># -d --> detached mode.
># jenkins_home is a varible folder you can name as you like
>```
>3. Initialize Jenkins
>  -- we have to provide initial password which is one time use in (/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword inside the container)
>```bash
>docker exec -it <id_of_conatiner>
># jenkins_home is a varible folder you can name as you like
>cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
># to check the volumes are mounted or not
>docker volume inspect jenkins_home
>```
>4. Install Plugins in jenkins.
>5. Create your first Admin User.
>6. Jenkins is ready to use at port 8080
